  abstract =      {It is proposed that the most important characteristic
                   of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple
                   kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
                   general numerical constraints roughly determine the
                   dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian
                   brain, and from these is derived a general model for
                   archicortex. The addition of further constraints
                   leads to the notion of a simple representation, which
                   is a way of translating a great deal of information
                   into the firing of about 200 out of a population of
                   10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} cells.
                   It is shown that if about
                   10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} simple
                   representations are stored in such a population of
                   cells, very little information about a single learnt
                   event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed
                   numerical examination is made of a particular example
                   of this kind of memory, and various general
                   conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight
                   gained from these models is used to derive theories
                   for various archicortical areas. A functional
                   interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of
                   the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the
                   prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia
                   dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
                   number of which must be true if the theory is
                   correct. A general functional classification of
                   typical archicortical cells is proposed.},

                   is a crucial feature of episodic memory. This ability
                   has long been hypothesized to require the
                   hippocampus, and computational models suggest that it
                   is dependent on pattern separation. However,

                   understood about the kinds of statistics it can
                   uncover. Prior studies have tested various forms of
                   structure that can be learned by tracking the
                   strength of transition probabilities between adjacent
                   items in a sequence. We test whether the hippocampus

                   have no variance in transition probability and
                   instead exhibit temporal community structure. We find
                   that the hippocampus is indeed sensitive to this form
                   of structure, as revealed by its representations,
                   activity dynamics, and connectivity with other

  abstract =      {A growing literature suggests that the hippocampus is
                   critical for the rapid extraction of regularities
                   from the environment. Although this fits with the
                   known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it
                   seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus
                   specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In
                   particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory
                   argues that there is a computational trade-off
                   between learning the specifics of individual
                   experiences and regularities that hold across those
                   experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the
                   hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and
                   memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a
                   neural network model that instantiates known
                   properties of hippocampal projections and subfields
                   to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We
                   found that the monosynaptic pathway\textemdash the
                   pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to
                   region CA1\textemdash was able to support statistical
                   learning, while the trisynaptic pathway\textemdash
                   connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate
                   gyrus and CA3\textemdash learned individual episodes,
                   with apparent representations of regularities
                   resulting from associative reactivation through
                   recurrence. Thus, in paradigms involving rapid
                   learning, the computational trade-off between

                   machine learning do not test the ability to learn or
                   remember specific instances of classes, a key feature
                   of animal intelligence. Distinguishing specific
                   instances is necessary for many real-world tasks,
                   such as remembering which cup belongs to you.
                   Generalisation within classes conflicts with the
                   ability to separate instances of classes, making it
                   difficult to achieve both capabilities within a
                   single architecture. We propose an extension to the
                   standard Omniglot classification-generalisation
                   framework that additionally tests the ability to
                   distinguish specific instances after one exposure and
                   introduces noise and occlusion corruption. Learning
                   is defined as an ability to classify as well as
                   recall training samples. Complementary Learning
                   Systems (CLS) is a popular model of mammalian brain
                   regions believed to play a crucial role in learning
                   from a single exposure to a stimulus. We created an
                   artificial neural network implementation of CLS and
                   applied it to the extended Omniglot benchmark. Our
                   unsupervised model demonstrates comparable
                   performance to existing supervised ANNs on the
                   Omniglot classification task (requiring
                   generalisation), without the need for domain-specific
                   inductive biases. On the extended Omniglot
                   instance-recognition task, the same model also
                   demonstrates significantly better performance than a
                   baseline nearest-neighbour approach, given partial
                   occlusion and noise.},

                   by artificial neural networks. Computational models
                   implementing these theories achieve learning as

                   simple synaptic plasticity rules based on activity of
                   presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The models have
                   similarities, such as including both feedforward and
                   feedback connections, allowing information about
                   error to propagate throughout the network.
                   Furthermore, they incorporate experimental evidence

                   These models provide insights on how brain networks

                   system relaying information from the neocortex to the
                   hippocampal formation. Long-term synaptic
                   potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path projections
                   to the dentate gyrus is well characterized. However,
                   surprisingly few studies have addressed the
                   mechanisms underlying LTP induction in the direct
                   perforant path projections to the hippocampus. Here
                   we investigate the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate
                   (NMDA) and opioid receptors in the induction of LTP
                   in monosynaptic medial and lateral perforant path
                   projections to the CA3 region in adult pentobarbital
                   sodium\textendash anesthetized rats. Similar to LTP
                   observed at the medial perforant path\textendash
                   dentate gyrus synapse, medial perforant
                   path\textendash CA3 synapses display LTP that is
                   blocked by both local and systemic administration of
                   the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist
                   ({$\pm$})-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)
                   propyl-1-phosphonic acid [({$\pm$})-CPP]. By
                   contrast, LTP induced at the lateral perforant
                   path\textendash CA3 synapses is not blocked by either
                   local or systemic administration of this NMDA
                   receptor antagonist. The induction of LTP at lateral
                   perforant path\textendash CA3 synapses, which is
                   blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone,
                   is also blocked by the selective mu ({$\mu$}) opioid
                   receptor antagonist Cys 2 -Tyr 3 -Orn 5 -Pen 7 -amide
                   (CTOP), but not the selective delta ({$\delta$})
                   opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (NTI). CTOP
                   was without effect on the induction of medial
                   perforant path\textendash CA3 LTP. The selective
                   sensitivity of lateral perforant path\textendash CA3
                   LTP to {$\mu$}-opioid receptor antagonists
                   corresponds with the distribution of {$\mu$}-opioid
                   receptors within the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of
                   area CA3 where perforant path projections to CA3
                   terminate. These data indicate that both lateral and
                   medial perforant path projections to the CA3 region
                   display LTP, and that LTP induction in medial and
                   lateral perforant path\textendash CA3 synapses are
                   differentially sensitive to NMDA receptor and
                   {$\mu$}-opioid receptor antagonists. This suggests a
                   role for opioid, but not NMDA receptors in the
                   induction of LTP at lateral perforant path
                   projections to the hippocampal formation.},

  abstract =      {The direct perforant path (PP) projection to CA3 is a
                   major source of cortical input to the hippocampal
                   region, yet relatively little is known about the
                   basic properties of physiology and plasticity in this
                   pathway. We tested whether PP long-term potentiation
                   (LTP) in CA3 possesses the Hebbian property of
                   associativity; i.e., whether the firing of fibers of
                   different orders can induce PP LTP. We stimulated PP
                   with weak trains of high-frequency stimulation (HFS),
                   which by itself was below the threshold for LTP
                   induction. The identical HFS was effective in
                   inducing LTP when the mossy fiber pathway (MF) was
                   activated simultaneously, thus demonstrating
                   associative plasticity between the two pathways. We
                   also demonstrated associative LTP between PP and
                   recurrent collateral fibers (RC). PP LTP was blocked
                   by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
                   antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid in both
                   the associative and homosynaptic induction
                   conditions. Neither MF nor RC fiber HFS alone
                   resulted in permanent changes in PP field excitatory
                   postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude. However,
                   HFS delivered to either MF or RC alone led to
                   transient heterosynaptic depression of the PP fEPSP.
                   Our results support the conceptual framework that
                   regards CA3 as an autoassociative memory network in
                   which efficient retrieval of previously stored
                   activity patterns is mediated by associative
                   plasticity of the PP synapse.},

                   associative memory storage and recall. We here report
                   that long-term potentiation (LTP) at the A/C synapses
                   can be induced by association of brief spike trains
                   in mossy fibers (MFs) from the dentate gyrus and A/C
                   fibers. This LTP not only required substantial
                   overlap between spike trains in MFs and A/C fibers,
                   but also depended on the temporal order of these
                   spike trains in a manner not predicted by the
                   wellknown rule of spike timing-dependent plasticity
                   and requiring activation of type 1 metabotropic
                   glutamate receptors. Importantly, spike trains in a

                   postsynaptic activity for the induction of LTP at A/C
                   synapses. Thus, the timing of spike trains in
                   individual MFs may code information that is crucial

                   how they process spatial information remains
                   enigmatic. To examine the role of GCs in spatial
                   coding, we measured excitatory postsynaptic
                   potentials (EPSPs) and action potentials (APs) in
                   head-fixed mice running on a linear belt.
                   Intracellular recording from morphologically
                   identified GCs revealed that most cells were active,
                   but activity level varied over a wide range. Whereas
                   only \$5\% of GCs showed spatially tuned spiking,
                   \$50\% received spatially tuned input. Thus, the GC
                   population broadly encodes spatial information, but
                   only a subset relays this information to the CA3
                   network. Fourier analysis indicated that GCs received
                   conjunctive place-grid-like synaptic input,
                   suggesting code conversion in single neurons. GC
                   firing was correlated with dendritic complexity and
                   intrinsic excitability, but not extrinsic excitatory
                   input or dendritic cable properties. Thus, functional
                   maturation may control input-output transformation

                   crucial function of the hippocampal-entorhinal
                   cortical network. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)
                   and CA3 are known to contribute to these functions,

                   projecting into DG and CA3, rapidly form a distinct

                   Island cells, excitatory pyramidal neurons in the
                   medial EC layer II projecting into CA1, are
                   indifferent to context-specific encoding or memory.
                   On the other hand, Ocean cells are dispensable for
                   temporal association learning, for which Island cells
                   are crucial. Together, the two excitatory medial EC
                   layer II inputs to the hippocampus have complementary

                   labeling technology allows a precise investigation of
                   the processes associated with the recall of a
                   specific memory. Here, we show that engram cell
                   excitability is transiently increased following
                   memory reactivation. This short-term increase of
                   engram excitability enhances the subsequent retrieval
                   of specific memory content in response to cues and is

                   same engram. The state of excitability of engram

  abstract =      {The entorhinal cortex (EC) is the major input and
                   output structure of the hippocampal formation,
                   forming the nodal point in cortico-hippocampal
                   circuits. Different division schemes including two or
                   many more subdivisions have been proposed, but here
                   we will argue that subdividing EC into two
                   components, the lateral (LEC) and medial EC (MEC)
                   might suffice to describe the functional architecture
                   of EC. This subdivision then leads to an anatomical
                   interpretation of the different phenotypes of LEC and
                   MEC. First, we will briefly summarize the
                   cytoarchitectonic differences and differences in
                   hippocampal projection patterns on which the
                   subdivision between LEC and MEC traditionally is
                   based and provide a short comparative perspective.
                   Second, we focus on main differences in cortical
                   connectivity, leading to the conclusion that the
                   apparent differences may well correlate with the
                   functional differences. Cortical connectivity of MEC
                   is features interactions with areas such as the
                   presubiculum, parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex and
                   postrhinal cortex, all areas that are considered to
                   belong to the 'spatial processing domain' of the
                   cortex. In contrast, LEC is strongly connected with
                   olfactory areas, insular, medial- and orbitofrontal
                   areas and perirhinal cortex. These areas are likely
                   more involved in processing of object information,
                   attention and motivation. Third, we will compare the
                   intrinsic networks involving principal- and
                   inter-neurons in LEC and MEC. Together, these
                   observations suggest that the different phenotypes of
                   both EC subdivisions likely depend on the combination
                   of intrinsic organization and specific sets of
                   inputs. We further suggest a reappraisal of the
                   notion of EC as a layered input-output structure for
                   the hippocampal formation.},

                   of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) form a functional
                   loop. Activation of the loop begins when the hippo-
                   campus detects newly arrived information that is not
                   already stored in its long-term memory. The resulting
                   novelty signal is conveyed through the subiculum,
                   accumbens, and ventral pallidum to the VTA where it
                   contributes (along with salience and goal informa-
                   tion) to the novelty-dependent firing of these cells.
                   In the upward arm of the loop, dopamine (DA) is re-

  abstract =      {During learning, the brain modifies synapses to
                   improve behaviour. In the cortex, synapses are
                   embedded within multilayered networks, making it
                   difficult to determine the effect of an individual
                   synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system.
                   The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in
                   deep artificial neural networks, but historically it
                   has been viewed as biologically problematic.
                   Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and
                   the successes of artificial neural networks have
                   reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation
                   offers insights for understanding learning in the
                   cortex. The backpropagation algorithm learns quickly
                   by computing synaptic updates using feedback
                   connections to deliver error signals. Although
                   feedback connections are ubiquitous in the cortex, it
                   is difficult to see how they could deliver the error
                   signals required by strict formulations of
                   backpropagation. Here we build on past and recent
                   developments to argue that feedback connections may
                   instead induce neural activities whose differences
                   can be used to locally approximate these signals and
                   hence drive effective learning in deep networks in
                   the brain.},
