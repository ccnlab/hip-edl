  abstract =      {It is proposed that the most important characteristic
                   of archicortex is its ability to perform a simple
                   kind of memorizing task. It is shown that rather
                   general numerical constraints roughly determine the
                   dimensions of memorizing models for the mammalian
                   brain, and from these is derived a general model for
                   archicortex. The addition of further constraints
                   leads to the notion of a simple representation, which
                   is a way of translating a great deal of information
                   into the firing of about 200 out of a population of
                   10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} cells.
                   It is shown that if about
                   10{$<$}latex{$>\$\sphat$}5\${$<$}/latex{$>$} simple
                   representations are stored in such a population of
                   cells, very little information about a single learnt
                   event is necessary to provoke its recall. A detailed
                   numerical examination is made of a particular example
                   of this kind of memory, and various general
                   conclusions are drawn from the analysis. The insight
                   gained from these models is used to derive theories
                   for various archicortical areas. A functional
                   interpretation is given of the cells and synapses of
                   the area entorhinalis, the prcsubiculum, the
                   prosubiculum, the cornu ammonis and the fascia
                   dentata. Many predictions are made, a substantial
                   number of which must be true if the theory is
                   correct. A general functional classification of
                   typical archicortical cells is proposed.},

                   is a crucial feature of episodic memory. This ability
                   has long been hypothesized to require the
                   hippocampus, and computational models suggest that it
                   is dependent on pattern separation. However,
                   empirical data for the role of the hippocampus in
                   pattern separation have not been available until
                   recently. This review summarizes data from
                   electrophysiological recordings, lesion studies,
                   immediate-early gene imaging, transgenic mouse
                   models, as well as human functional neuroimaging,
                   that provide convergent evidence for the involvement
                   of particular hippocampal subfields in this key
                   process. We discuss the impact of aging and adult
                   neurogenesis on pattern separation, and also
                   highlight several challenges to linking across
                   species and approaches, and suggest future directions

                   representation of temporal statistics, but little is
                   understood about the kinds of statistics it can
                   uncover. Prior studies have tested various forms of
                   structure that can be learned by tracking the
                   strength of transition probabilities between adjacent
                   items in a sequence. We test whether the hippocampus
                   can learn higher-order structure using sequences that
                   have no variance in transition probability and
                   instead exhibit temporal community structure. We find
                   that the hippocampus is indeed sensitive to this form
                   of structure, as revealed by its representations,
                   activity dynamics, and connectivity with other
                   regions. These findings suggest that the hippocampus

                   critical for the rapid extraction of regularities
                   from the environment. Although this fits with the
                   known role of the hippocampus in rapid learning, it
                   seems at odds with the idea that the hippocampus
                   specializes in memorizing individual episodes. In
                   particular, the Complementary Learning Systems theory
                   argues that there is a computational trade-off
                   between learning the specifics of individual
                   experiences and regularities that hold across those
                   experiences. We asked whether it is possible for the
                   hippocampus to handle both statistical learning and
                   memorization of individual episodes. We exposed a
                   neural network model that instantiates known
                   properties of hippocampal projections and subfields
                   to sequences of items with temporal regularities. We
                   found that the monosynaptic pathway\textemdash the
                   pathway connecting entorhinal cortex directly to
                   region CA1\textemdash was able to support statistical
                   learning, while the trisynaptic pathway\textemdash
                   connecting entorhinal cortex to CA1 through dentate
                   gyrus and CA3\textemdash learned individual episodes,
                   with apparent representations of regularities
                   resulting from associative reactivation through
                   recurrence. Thus, in paradigms involving rapid
                   learning, the computational trade-off between
                   learning episodes and regularities may be handled by
                   separate anatomical pathways within the hippocampus

                   machine learning do not test the ability to learn or
                   remember specific instances of classes, a key feature
                   of animal intelligence. Distinguishing specific
                   instances is necessary for many real-world tasks,
                   such as remembering which cup belongs to you.
                   Generalisation within classes conflicts with the
                   ability to separate instances of classes, making it
                   difficult to achieve both capabilities within a
                   single architecture. We propose an extension to the
                   standard Omniglot classification-generalisation
                   framework that additionally tests the ability to
                   distinguish specific instances after one exposure and
                   introduces noise and occlusion corruption. Learning
                   is defined as an ability to classify as well as
                   recall training samples. Complementary Learning
                   Systems (CLS) is a popular model of mammalian brain
                   regions believed to play a crucial role in learning
                   from a single exposure to a stimulus. We created an
                   artificial neural network implementation of CLS and
                   applied it to the extended Omniglot benchmark. Our
                   unsupervised model demonstrates comparable
                   performance to existing supervised ANNs on the
                   Omniglot classification task (requiring
                   generalisation), without the need for domain-specific
                   inductive biases. On the extended Omniglot
                   instance-recognition task, the same model also
                   demonstrates significantly better performance than a
                   baseline nearest-neighbour approach, given partial
                   occlusion and noise.},

                   approximate the error back-propagation algorithm used
                   by artificial neural networks. Computational models
                   implementing these theories achieve learning as

                   simple synaptic plasticity rules based on activity of
                   presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The models have
                   similarities, such as including both feedforward and
                   feedback connections, allowing information about
                   error to propagate throughout the network.
                   Furthermore, they incorporate experimental evidence

                   difficult to determine the effect of an individual
                   synaptic modification on the behaviour of the system.
                   The backpropagation algorithm solves this problem in
                   deep artificial neural networks, but historically it
                   has been viewed as biologically problematic.
                   Nonetheless, recent developments in neuroscience and
                   the successes of artificial neural networks have
                   reinvigorated interest in whether backpropagation
                   offers insights for understanding learning in the

                   by computing synaptic updates using feedback

                   instead induce neural activities whose differences
                   can be used to locally approximate these signals and

                   output structure of the hippocampal formation,
                   forming the nodal point in cortico-hippocampal
                   circuits. Different division schemes including two or
                   many more subdivisions have been proposed, but here
                   we will argue that subdividing EC into two
                   components, the lateral (LEC) and medial EC (MEC)
                   might suffice to describe the functional architecture
                   of EC. This subdivision then leads to an anatomical
                   interpretation of the different phenotypes of LEC and
                   MEC. First, we will briefly summarize the
                   cytoarchitectonic differences and differences in
                   hippocampal projection patterns on which the
                   subdivision between LEC and MEC traditionally is
                   based and provide a short comparative perspective.
                   Second, we focus on main differences in cortical
                   connectivity, leading to the conclusion that the
                   apparent differences may well correlate with the
                   functional differences. Cortical connectivity of MEC
                   is features interactions with areas such as the
                   presubiculum, parasubiculum, retrosplenial cortex and
                   postrhinal cortex, all areas that are considered to
                   belong to the 'spatial processing domain' of the
                   cortex. In contrast, LEC is strongly connected with
                   olfactory areas, insular, medial- and orbitofrontal
                   areas and perirhinal cortex. These areas are likely
                   more involved in processing of object information,
                   attention and motivation. Third, we will compare the
                   intrinsic networks involving principal- and
                   inter-neurons in LEC and MEC. Together, these
                   observations suggest that the different phenotypes of
                   both EC subdivisions likely depend on the combination
                   of intrinsic organization and specific sets of
                   inputs. We further suggest a reappraisal of the
                   notion of EC as a layered input-output structure for
                   the hippocampal formation.},

                   spatial memory and learning. Recently, a theoretical
                   model of the hippocampus based on temporal difference
                   (TD) learning has been published. Inspired by the
                   successor representation (SR) learning algorithms,
                   which decompose value function of TD learning into
                   reward and state transition, they argued that the
                   rate of firing of CA1 place cells in the hippocampus
                   represents the probability of state transition. This
                   theory, called predictive map theory, claims that the
                   hippocampus representing space learns the probability
                   of transition from the current state to the future
                   state. The neural correlates of expecting the future
                   state are the firing rates of the CA1 place cells.
                   This explanation is plausible for the results
                   recorded in behavioral experiments, but it is lacking
                   the neurobiological implications.},

                   expressed in a variety of forms mediated by a
                   multitude of mechanisms. Here we consider two broad
                   kinds of plasticity that differ in their requirement
                   for presynaptic activity during the induction.
                   Homosynaptic plasticity occurs at synapses that were
                   active during the induction. It is also called input
                   specific or associative, and it is governed by
                   Hebbian-type learning rules. Heterosynaptic
                   plasticity can be induced by episodes of strong
                   postsynaptic activity also at synapses that were not
                   active during the induction, thus making any synapse
                   at a cell a target to heterosynaptic changes. Both
                   forms can be induced by typical protocols used for
                   plasticity induction and operate on the same time
                   scales but have differential computational properties
                   and play different roles in learning systems.
                   Homosynaptic plasticity mediates associative
                   modifications of synaptic weights. Heterosynaptic
                   plasticity counteracts runaway dynamics introduced by
                   Hebbian-type rules and balances synaptic changes. It
                   provides learning systems with stability and enhances
                   synaptic competition. We conclude that homosynaptic
                   and heterosynaptic plasticity represent complementary
                   properties of modifiable synapses, and both are
                   necessary for normal operation of neural systems with
                   plastic synapses.},

                   system relaying information from the neocortex to the
                   hippocampal formation. Long-term synaptic
                   potentiation (LTP) in the perforant path projections
                   to the dentate gyrus is well characterized. However,
                   surprisingly few studies have addressed the
                   mechanisms underlying LTP induction in the direct
                   perforant path projections to the hippocampus. Here
                   we investigate the role of N-methyl-d-aspartate
                   (NMDA) and opioid receptors in the induction of LTP
                   in monosynaptic medial and lateral perforant path
                   projections to the CA3 region in adult pentobarbital
                   sodium\textendash anesthetized rats. Similar to LTP
                   observed at the medial perforant path\textendash
                   dentate gyrus synapse, medial perforant
                   path\textendash CA3 synapses display LTP that is
                   blocked by both local and systemic administration of
                   the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist
                   ({$\pm$})-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)
                   propyl-1-phosphonic acid [({$\pm$})-CPP]. By
                   contrast, LTP induced at the lateral perforant
                   path\textendash CA3 synapses is not blocked by either
                   local or systemic administration of this NMDA
                   receptor antagonist. The induction of LTP at lateral
                   perforant path\textendash CA3 synapses, which is
                   blocked by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone,
                   is also blocked by the selective mu ({$\mu$}) opioid
                   receptor antagonist Cys 2 -Tyr 3 -Orn 5 -Pen 7 -amide
                   (CTOP), but not the selective delta ({$\delta$})
                   opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole (NTI). CTOP
                   was without effect on the induction of medial
                   perforant path\textendash CA3 LTP. The selective
                   sensitivity of lateral perforant path\textendash CA3
                   LTP to {$\mu$}-opioid receptor antagonists
                   corresponds with the distribution of {$\mu$}-opioid
                   receptors within the stratum lacunosum-moleculare of
                   area CA3 where perforant path projections to CA3
                   terminate. These data indicate that both lateral and
                   medial perforant path projections to the CA3 region
                   display LTP, and that LTP induction in medial and
                   lateral perforant path\textendash CA3 synapses are
                   differentially sensitive to NMDA receptor and
                   {$\mu$}-opioid receptor antagonists. This suggests a
                   role for opioid, but not NMDA receptors in the
                   induction of LTP at lateral perforant path
                   projections to the hippocampal formation.},

                   major source of cortical input to the hippocampal
                   region, yet relatively little is known about the
                   basic properties of physiology and plasticity in this
                   pathway. We tested whether PP long-term potentiation
                   (LTP) in CA3 possesses the Hebbian property of
                   associativity; i.e., whether the firing of fibers of
                   different orders can induce PP LTP. We stimulated PP
                   with weak trains of high-frequency stimulation (HFS),
                   which by itself was below the threshold for LTP
                   induction. The identical HFS was effective in
                   inducing LTP when the mossy fiber pathway (MF) was
                   activated simultaneously, thus demonstrating
                   associative plasticity between the two pathways. We
                   also demonstrated associative LTP between PP and
                   recurrent collateral fibers (RC). PP LTP was blocked
                   by the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
                   antagonist 2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid in both
                   the associative and homosynaptic induction
                   conditions. Neither MF nor RC fiber HFS alone
                   resulted in permanent changes in PP field excitatory
                   postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) amplitude. However,
                   HFS delivered to either MF or RC alone led to
                   transient heterosynaptic depression of the PP fEPSP.
                   Our results support the conceptual framework that
                   regards CA3 as an autoassociative memory network in
                   which efficient retrieval of previously stored
                   activity patterns is mediated by associative
                   plasticity of the PP synapse.},

                   associative memory storage and recall. We here report
                   that long-term potentiation (LTP) at the A/C synapses
                   can be induced by association of brief spike trains
                   in mossy fibers (MFs) from the dentate gyrus and A/C
                   fibers. This LTP not only required substantial
                   overlap between spike trains in MFs and A/C fibers,
                   but also depended on the temporal order of these

                   multiple contexts and episodes is thought to be a
                   crucial function of the hippocampal-entorhinal
                   cortical network. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)
                   and CA3 are known to contribute to these functions,
                   but the role of the entorhinal cortex (EC) is poorly
                   understood. Here, we show that Ocean cells,
                   excitatory stellate neurons in the medial EC layer II
                   projecting into DG and CA3, rapidly form a distinct
                   representation of a novel context and drive
                   context-specific activation of downstream CA3 cells
                   as well as context-specific fear memory. In contrast,
                   Island cells, excitatory pyramidal neurons in the
                   medial EC layer II projecting into CA1, are
                   indifferent to context-specific encoding or memory.
                   On the other hand, Ocean cells are dispensable for
                   temporal association learning, for which Island cells
                   are crucial. Together, the two excitatory medial EC
                   layer II inputs to the hippocampus have complementary
                   roles in episodic memory.},

                   or attractor network used in episodic memory system
                   is described. In this theory, the CA3 system operates
                   as a single attractor or autoassociation network to
                   enable rapid, one-trial, associations between any
                   spatial location (place in rodents, or spatial view
                   in primates) and an object or reward, and to provide
                   for completion of the whole memory during recall from
                   any part. The theory is extended to associations
                   between time and object or reward to implement
                   temporal order memory, also important in episodic
                   memory. The dentate gyrus (DG) performs pattern
                   separation by competitive learning to produce sparse
                   representations suitable for setting up new
                   representations in CA3 during learning, producing for
                   example neurons with place-like fields from
                   entorhinal cortex grid cells. The dentate granule
                   cells produce by the very small number of mossy fiber
                   (MF) connections to CA3 a randomizing pattern
                   separation effect important during learning but not
                   recall that separates out the patterns represented by
                   CA3 firing to be very different from each other,
                   which is optimal for an unstructured episodic memory
                   system in which each memory must be kept distinct
                   from other memories. The direct perforant path (pp)
                   input to CA3 is quantitatively appropriate to provide
                   the cue for recall in CA3, but not for learning.
                   Tests of the theory including hippocampal subregion
                   analyses and hippocampal NMDA receptor knockouts are

                   a real-time optical recording system, which had high
                   spatial resolution of 128\texttimes 128 points with a
                   high time resolution of 0.6ms. Serial excitatory
                   propagation was recorded in the dentate gyrus, CA3
                   and CA1 after stimulation of the perforant pathway,
                   and the optical signals were clearly divided into two
                   components in the dentate gyrus adjacent to the
                   stimulus site. The slow component was suppressed in
                   Ca2+-free solution, but the fast component in the
                   molecular layer was not affected. However, the
                   application of 1{$\mu$}M tetrodotoxin fully abolished
                   both components. These results suggest that the fast
                   and slow components mainly reflect Na+-dependent
                   action potentials and excitatory postsynaptic
                   potentials, respectively. The excitatory response
                   duration in the stratum radiatum of CA3 was
                   significantly longer than that in other hippocampal
                   areas. The long-lasting excitation in CA3 is probably
                   related to the CA3 associational projections, because
                   direct stimulation of CA3 pyramidal cell layer also
                   produced similar results. The long-lasting dendritic
                   excitation is probably important to integrate
                   synaptic transmission and may be related to
                   epileptogenesis. When long-term potentiation was
                   induced by a tetanic stimulation (100Hz for 1s), the
                   onset latency in the stratum radiatum of CA1 was
                   reduced to as much as 65\%, suggesting an increase of
                   excitatory propagation. The analysis of the
                   spatial\textendash temporal optical signals
                   contributes to understanding information processes in
                   the hippocampus, related to learning and memory

                   successful retrieval of an item from memory affects
                   retention only because the retrieval provides an
                   additional presentation of the target item. Two
                   methods of learning paired associates were compared,
                   In the pure study trial (pure ST condition) method,
                   both items of a pair were presented simultaneously
                   for study. In the test trial/study trial (TTST
                   condition) method, subjects attempted to retrieve the
                   response term during aperiod in which only the
                   stimulus term was present (and the response term of
                   the pair was presented after a 5-sec delay).
                   Finalretention of target items was tested with
                   cued-recall tests. In Experiment 1, there was a
                   reliable advantagein final testing for
                   nonsense-syllable/number pairs in the TTST condition
                   over pairs in the pure ST condition. In Experiment 2,
                   the same result was obtained with Eskimo/English word
                   pairs, This benefit of the TTST condition was not
                   apparently different for final retrieval after 5 min
                   or after 24 h. Experiments 3 and 4 ruled out two
                   artifactual explanations of the TTST advantage
                   observed in the first two experiments. Because
                   performing a memory retrieval (TTST condition) led to
                   better performance than pure study (pure ST
                   condition), the results reject the hypothesis that a
                   successful retrieval is beneficial only to the extent
                   that it provides another study experience.},

                   instantiated in a computational model called REMERGE
                   (recurrency and episodic memory results in
                   generalization). We expose a fundamental, but
                   neglected, tension between prevailing computational
                   theories that emphasize the function of the
                   hippocampus in pattern separation (Marr, 1971;
                   McClelland, McNaughton, \& O'Reilly, 1995), and
                   empirical support for its role in generalization and
                   flexible relational memory (Cohen \& Eichenbaum,
                   1993; Eichenbaum, 1999). Our account provides a means
                   by which to resolve this conflict, by demonstrating
                   that the basic representational scheme envisioned by
                   complementary learning systems theory (McClelland et
                   al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in
                   the hippocampus, is compatible with efficient
                   generalization-as long as there is recurrence rather
                   than unidirectional flow within the hippocampal
                   circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and
                   neocortex. We propose that recurrent similarity
                   computation, a process that facilitates the discovery
                   of higher-order relationships between a set of
                   related experiences, expands the scope of classical
                   exemplar-based models of memory (e.g., Nosofsky,
                   1984) and allows the hippocampus to support
                   generalization through interactions that unfold
                   within a dynamically created memory space.},

                   this relates to the interval between a synaptic input
                   and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual
                   link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have
                   documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions,
                   and computational models have tested its utility in
                   many neural network functions. However, questions
                   remain about whether timing plays a role in
                   plasticity during natural activity, and whether it
                   can function in information storage. The present
                   study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to
                   investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the
                   plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of
                   hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by
                   sequential dual-site stimulation at 10 ms intervals
                   of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies
                   (synaptic\textendash somatic induction) or of two
                   sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic\textendash synaptic
                   induction). Both protocols potentiated responses,
                   with greater potentiation of responses to the first
                   stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither
                   of these protocols induced depression.
                   Synaptic\textendash somatic stimulation was much more
                   effective than synaptic\textendash synaptic
                   stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but
                   both protocols potentiated responses equally well.
                   This suggests that sequential dual-site stimulation
                   can potentiate equally well with very different
                   degrees of somatic action potential firing. With
                   synaptic\textendash somatic induction, potentiation
                   was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast,
                   with synaptic\textendash synaptic induction, the
                   distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes
                   in the spatial distribution of responses indicated
                   that sequential dual-site stimulation functions
                   poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These
                   results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region,
                   timed sequential activation of two inputs is less
                   effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of
                   LTP and in the storage of information.},

                   during different parts of the theta cycle. A model of
                   the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus is presented,
                   using biophysical representations of the major cell
                   types including pyramidal cells and two types of
                   interneurons. Inputs to the network come from the
                   septum and the entorhinal cortex (directly and by the
                   dentate gyrus). A mechanism for parsing the theta
                   rhythm into two epochs is proposed and simulated: in
                   the first half, the strong, proximal input from the
                   dentate to a subset of CA3 pyramidal cells and

                   information. During the second half of theta, cueing
                   signals from the entorhinal cortex, by the dentate,
                   activate previously strengthened synapses, retrieving

                   the entrance to the hippocampus, blocking or
                   filtering incoming excitation from the entorhinal
                   cortex, has been an intriguing one. Here we review
                   the historical development of the idea, and discuss
                   whether it may be possible to be more specific in
                   defining this gate. We propose that dentate function
                   can be understood within a context of Hebbian
                   association and competition: hilar mossy cells help
                   the dentate granule cells to recognize incoming
                   entorhinal patterns of activity (Hebbian
                   association), after which patterns that are
                   consistently and repetitively presented to the
                   dentate gyrus are passed through, while random, more
                   transient patterns are blocked (non-associative
                   Hebbian competition). Translamellar inhibition as
                   well as translamellar potentiation can be understood
                   in this context. The dentate-hilar complex thus plays
                   the role of a ``pattern excluder'', not a pattern
                   completer. The unique role of pattern exclusion may
                   explain the peculiar qualities of dentate granule
                   cells and hilar mossy cells.},

  abstract =      {A hallmark of human intelligence is the ability to
                   adapt to new situations, by applying learned rules to
                   new content (systematicity) and thereby enabling an
                   open-ended number of inferences and actions
                   (generativity). Here, we propose that the human brain
                   accomplishes these feats through pathways in the
                   parietal cortex that encode the abstract structure of
                   space, events, and tasks, and pathways in the
                   temporal cortex that encode information about
                   specific people, places, and things (content). Recent
                   neural network models show how the separation of
                   structure and content might emerge through a
                   combination of architectural biases and learning, and

                   spatially selective firing of pyramidal cells in the
                   CA1 field of the rat hippocampus tends to advance to
                   earlier phases of the electroencephalogram theta
                   rhythm as a rat passes through the place field of a
                   cell. We present here a neural network model based on
                   integrate-and-fire neurons that accounts for this
                   effect. In this model, place selectivity in the
                   hippocampus is a consequence of synaptic interactions
                   between pyramidal neurons together with weakly
                   selective external input. The phase shift of neuronal
                   spiking arises in the model as a result of asymmetric
                   spread of activation through the network, caused by
                   asymmetry in the synaptic interactions. Several
                   experimentally observed properties of the phase shift
                   effect follow naturally from the model, including 1)
                   the observation that the first spikes a cell fires
                   appear near the theta phase corresponding to minimal
                   population activity, 2) the overall advance is less
                   than 360\textdegree, and 3) the location of the rat
                   within the place field of the cell is the primary
                   correlate of the firing phase, not the time the rat
                   has been in the field. The model makes several
                   predictions concerning the emergence of place fields
                   during the earliest stages of exploration in a novel
                   environment. It also suggests new experiments that
                   could provide further constraints on a possible
                   explanation of the phase precession effect.

                   for hippocampal function, embracing the idea that
                   place cells encode a geometric representation of
                   space. However, evidence for predictive coding,
                   reward sensitivity and policy dependence in place
                   cells suggests that the representation is not purely
                   spatial. We approach this puzzle from a reinforcement
                   learning perspective: what kind of spatial
                   representation is most useful for maximizing future
                   reward? We show that the answer takes the form of a
                   predictive representation. This representation
                   captures many aspects of place cell responses that
                   fall outside the traditional view of a cognitive map.
                   Furthermore, we argue that entorhinal grid cells
                   encode a low-dimensionality basis set for the
                   predictive representation, useful for suppressing
                   noise in predictions and extracting multiscale

                   predictions about upcoming events. The hippocampus

                   people envision future events, and damage that
                   includes the hippocampal region impairs this ability.
                   In rats, hippocampal ensembles preplay and replay
                   event sequences in the absence of overt behavior. If
                   strung together in novel combinations, these

  abstract =      {Perception can be cast as a process of inference, in
                   which bottom-up signals are combined with top-down
                   predictions in sensory systems. In line with this,
                   neural activity in sensory cortex is strongly
                   modulated by prior expectations. Such top-down
                   predictions often arise from cross-modal
                   associations, such as when a sound (e.g., bell or
                   bark) leads to an expectation of the visual
                   appearance of the corresponding object (e.g., bicycle
                   or dog). We hypothesized that the hippocampus, which
                   rapidly learns arbitrary relationships between
                   stimuli over space and time, may be involved in
                   forming such associative predictions. We exposed male
                   and female human participants to auditory cues
                   predicting visual shapes, while measuring
                   high-resolution fMRI signals in visual cortex and the
                   hippocampus. Using multivariate reconstruction
                   methods, we discovered a dissociation between these
                   regions: representations in visual cortex were
                   dominated by whichever shape was presented, whereas
                   representations in the hippocampus reflected only
                   which shape was predicted by the cue. The strength of
                   hippocampal predictions correlated across
                   participants with the amount of expectation-related
                   facilitation in visual cortex. These findings help
                   bridge the gap between memory and sensory systems in
                   the human brain. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The way we
                   perceive the world is to a great extent determined by
                   our prior knowledge. Despite this intimate link
                   between perception and memory, these two aspects of
                   cognition have mostly been studied in isolation. Here
                   we investigate their interaction by asking how memory
                   systems that encode and retrieve associations can
                   inform perception. We find that upon hearing a
                   familiar auditory cue, the hippocampus represents
                   visual information that had previously co-occurred
                   with the cue, even when this expectation differs from
                   what is currently visible. Furthermore, the strength
                   of this hippocampal expectation correlates with
                   facilitation of perceptual processing in visual
                   cortex. These findings help bridge the gap between
                   memory and sensory systems in the human brain.},

                   experimental and clinical research illustrate that
                   the hippocampus is central to the processing of
                   episodic memories, and this is in large part due to
                   its analysis of context information according to
                   spatial and temporal references. In this way,
                   hippocampus defines ones expectations for a given
                   context as well as detects errors in predicted
                   contextual features. The detection of context
                   prediction errors is hypothesized to distinguished
                   events into meaningful epochs that come to be
                   recalled as separate episodic memories. The nature of

                   mediated by natural homeostatic operations and
                   plasticity. Context prediction errors by hippocampus
                   are suggested to be valued by the midbrain dopamine
                   system, the output of which is ultimately fed back to
                   hippocampus to update memory-driven context
                   expectations for future events. Thus, multiple
                   network functions (both within and outside

                   ability to form relationships between items or events
                   that were not experienced together. This review
                   considers different perspectives on the role of the
                   hippocampus in successful inferential reasoning
                   during both memory encoding and retrieval.
                   Intuitively, inference can be thought of as a logical
                   process by which elements of individual existing
                   memories are retrieved and recombined to answer novel
                   questions. Such flexible retrieval is sub-served by
                   the hippocampus and is thought to require specialized
                   hippocampal encoding mechanisms that discretely code
                   events such that event elements are individually
                   accessible from memory. In addition to
                   retrieval-based inference, recent research has also
                   focused on hippocampal processes that support the
                   combination of information acquired across multiple
                   experiences during encoding. This mechanism suggests
                   that by recalling past events during new experiences,
                   connections can be created between newly formed and
                   existing memories. Such hippocampally mediated memory
                   integration would thus underlie the formation of
                   networks of related memories that extend beyond
                   direct experience to anticipate future judgments
                   about the relationships between items and events. We
                   also discuss integrative encoding in the context of
                   emerging evidence linking the hippocampus to the
                   formation of schemas as well as prospective theories
                   of hippocampal function that suggest memories are
                   actively constructed to anticipate future decisions

                   experimental findings and neuroecological
                   considerations. Under this model, the mammalian
                   hippocampus evolved to simulate and evaluate
                   arbitrary navigation sequences. Specifically, we
                   suggest that CA3 simulates unexperienced navigation
                   sequences in addition to remembering experienced
                   ones, and CA1 selects from among these CA3-generated
                   sequences, reinforcing those that are likely to
                   maximize reward during offline idling states.
                   High-value sequences reinforced in CA1 may allow
                   flexible navigation toward a potential rewarding
                   location during subsequent navigation. We argue that
                   the simulationselection functions of the hippocampus
                   have evolved in mammals mostly because of the unique
                   navigational needs of land mammals. Our model may
                   account for why the mammalian hippocampus has evolved
                   not only to remember, but also to imagine episodes,
                   and how this might be implemented in its neural
                   circuits.},

                   According to supervised learning models that are
                   trained to predict outcomes in the world, integration
                   should occur when two stimuli predict the same
                   outcome. Numerous findings support this, but
                   \textendash{} paradoxically \textendash{} some recent
                   fMRI studies have found that pairing different

                   and related findings, we argue that supervised
                   learning needs to be supplemented with unsupervised
                   learning that is driven by spreading activation in a
                   U-shaped way, such that inactive memories are not
                   modified, moderate activation of memories causes
                   weakening (leading to differentiation), and higher
                   activation causes strengthening (leading to

                   cognitive function by coordinating spike timing

                   known when timing is either critical for neural
                   computations or an epiphenomenon. The entorhinal
                   cortex and hippocampus are necessary for learning and
                   memory and exhibit prominent theta oscillations
                   (6\textendash 9\,Hz), which are controlled by

                   show that entorhinal and hippocampal neuronal
                   activity patterns were strongly entrained by rhythmic
                   optical stimulation of parvalbumin-positive medial

                   entrainment, memory impairments in a spatial working

                   at or below the endogenous theta frequency and only

                   segments where encoding occurs. Neural computations
                   during the encoding phase were therefore selectively

                   neuron. Our simple model predicts correctly the
                   timing of 96\% of the spikes ({$\pm$}2 ms) of the
                   detailed model in response to injection of noisy
                   synaptic conductances. The model is especially
                   reliable in high-conductance states, typical of
                   cortical activity in vivo, in which intrinsic
                   conductances were found to have a reduced role in
                   shaping spike trains. These results are promising
                   because this simple model has enough expressive power
                   to reproduce qualitatively several
